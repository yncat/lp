## [Nyanchan's House](https://www.nyanchangames.com/)

This is my personal homepage. It mainly features works I've created personally. If you explore thoroughly, you can find some old content that's still preserved.

## [Cat's Front Paw](https://yncat.github.io)

This is my personal blog. I mainly write about technical topics. It's mostly notes, but occasionally there are serious review articles, how-to articles, and travel journals from my overseas trips.

## [ACT Laboratory](https://actlab.org/)

This is the homepage of a voluntary organization I run with high school classmates and several other friends. It's a group of visually impaired engineers who develop open source software together. Some projects are not open source due to licensing requirements.

## [yncat YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@yncat)

This is my personal YouTube channel where I occasionally post content. I'm just playing games.

## [Invisible Gaming Lab YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@igl3359)

This is a YouTube channel I manage with several friends, introducing games that can be played without looking at the screen. Unlike my personal channel, this one provides proper explanations and analysis, as well as tips and techniques for playing the games.

## [Audio Game Center](https://audiogame.center/)

This is a project I've been working on since 2017, aimed at creating audio-based experiential game centers in various locations. We have showcased at Tokyo Game Show and Ginza Sony Park, among other venues.
