IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab) has been hosting monthly game experience sessions since this year. We rent the venue at [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we had a triple feature:

- [Touchalle](https://camp-fire.jp/projects/view/681357)
- [Four Senses](https://sugorokuya.jp/p/four-senses)
- [Chess](https://www.chesshouse.com/collections/chess-for-blind-or-visually-impaired/products/wooden-chess-set-for-the-blind-3-75-inch-king)

Touchalle is a card game that uses shapes and patterns to enjoy through touch. It seems to have sold out already. Unfortunately.

Four Senses is like a 3D four-in-a-row game. Details are available on the official site.

Making its debut this time was chess. We imported a tactile chess board from America and tried playing with it.

We ran out of time and could only play this much, but since this was my first time playing chess, it was quite enjoyable.

As IGL, we hope to continue hosting monthly sessions!
