Every November, the [Comprehensive Event for Visually Impaired People - Sight World](https://www.sight-world.com/) is held.

Sight World consists of two main areas: a booth where experts from various fields give lectures, and an exhibition booth area by participating companies. This time, we [ACT Laboratory](https://actlab.org/) had the opportunity to speak as part of the NVDA Japanese team's "Life With NVDA" lecture.

During the lecture, we introduced ACT Laboratory's activities using the development of "add-ons", which are NVDA extensions, as our theme. Also, since many ACT Laboratory members work as technical specialists at IT companies, we briefly introduced what our daily work looks like.
