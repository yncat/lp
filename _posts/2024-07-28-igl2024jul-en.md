IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab) has been hosting monthly game experience sessions since this year. We rent the venue at [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we had a quadruple feature:

- [Touchalle](https://camp-fire.jp/projects/view/681357)
- [Four Senses](https://sugorokuya.jp/p/four-senses)
- Master's handmade chess
- [Animal Shogi](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E3%81%B6%E3%81%A4%E3%81%97%E3%82%87%E3%81%86%E3%81%8E)

Touchalle is a card game that uses shapes and patterns to enjoy through touch. It seems to have sold out already. Unfortunately.

Four Senses is like a 3D four-in-a-row game. Details are available on the official site.

Chess was also available [last time](https://yncat.net/posts/igl), but this time, amazingly, the master of Luxen had completed handmade chess boards after much trial and error. And there were four different types: glass, wooden, velcro-fixed, and handmade clay versions!

Snacks are served each time, and I thought I'd start including photos of those snacks from now on.

Next time, the August session date is undecided, but next will be a digital game session!
