[IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab)](https://x.com/IGL_official_AC) has been hosting monthly game experience sessions since 2024. We rent the venue at [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we had a double feature:

- [Touchalle](https://ideapot.thebase.in/items/82918967)
- [Lucky Numbers Deluxe & Access](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%A0%AA%E5%BC%8F%E4%BC%9A%E7%A4%BE%E3%82%B1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%93%E3%83%AB-4573346505653-%E3%82%B1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%93%E3%83%AB-%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC-%E3%83%87%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%EF%BC%86%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%82%B9/dp/B0CWL2DS7W)

This marked the debut of the board game Lucky Numbers.

Lucky Numbers is apparently a quite famous board game, but the regular version comes as just thick cardboard pieces. When you purchase the "Deluxe & Access" version linked above, you get a fully accessible version with raised numbers and braille stickers.

The basic rules are very simple:

1. Shuffle all the clovers face down.
2. Each player takes their game board and prepares it empty.
3. All players take 4 clovers face down and place them diagonally from top-left to bottom-right. The initial placement spots look different in color. Setup complete.
4. Each player either takes a clover from the face-down deck or takes one clover from the face-up discard pile.
5. Then they either swap it with one piece on their board, place it on their board without swapping, or send it directly to the discard pile face up.
6. There are rules for how clovers can be arranged on the board, and rule-violating placements are not allowed.
7. Continue taking turns like this, and the first person to fill their entire 4x4 game board with clovers wins.

The clover placement rules are as follows:

- Numbers must increase from top to bottom
- Numbers must increase from left to right

That's it! This might even be useful for children learning number sequences.

This time's snack was ice cream prepared for us. But I forgot to take a photo, so there isn't one.

The reason these session announcements are sporadic is because I only write about them when I can participate as an organizer. Sometimes schedules conflict and I can't attend...
