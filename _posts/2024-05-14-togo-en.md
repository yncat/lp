I introduced the accessibility of freee HR at the "Accessibility" booth at [Freee Togo World](https://www.freee.co.jp/lp2/togo-world-2024/).

While I usually work on freee Card, I participated as an accessibility helper this time.

I think accessibility will become an important field in Japan going forward, so please look forward to it.
