[IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab)](https://x.com/IGL_official_AC) has been hosting monthly game experience sessions since 2024. The venue is [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we played three games:

- [Lucky Numbers Deluxe & Access](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%A0%AA%E5%BC%8F%E4%BC%9A%E7%A4%BE%E3%82%B1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%93%E3%83%AB-4573346505653-%E3%82%B1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%93%E3%83%AB-%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC-%E3%83%87%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%EF%BC%86%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%82%B9/dp/B0CWL2DS7W)
- [Vulture's Prey (Hagetaka no Ejiki)](https://www.mobius-games.co.jp/mobiusgames/Hagetaka.html)
- Yu-Gi-Oh! Royal Deck Accessible Edition

## About Yu-Gi-Oh! Royal Deck Accessible Edition

Since the other games have been introduced before, please refer to past articles for details.

This time, I'll introduce the Yu-Gi-Oh! Royal Deck Accessible Edition, which is making its debut.

[Yu-Gi-Oh! Royal Deck](https://note.com/todai_yugioh/n/nf319e44e49b7) consists of six types of structure decks constructed by the University of Tokyo Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Circle. The Yu-Gi-Oh! Royal Deck Accessible Edition is created by adding Braille and tagged stickers to these deck cards, allowing dueling even when cards cannot be seen.

This accessible edition deck was conceived, designed, and created by IGL members in collaboration with blind duelists and collaborators.

Currently, it is not for sale and can only be played at IGL game experience sessions.

[You can watch an explanatory video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3yFx8DclcI).

Round stickers with tag functionality are attached to the bottom left of the accessible edition cards. Monster cards have three stickers, while spell/trap cards have two stickers. By touching the stickers with a dedicated pen, you can get card information through speech.

For monster cards:
- Leftmost sticker: Monster name, type, attribute, level
- Center sticker: Attack points, defense points
- Rightmost sticker: Monster effect or flavor text

For spell/trap cards:
- Left sticker: Type (spell or trap) + card name, and information for quick-play, continue, field spells and counter traps
- Right sticker: Effect

The dedicated pen has a socket for wired earphones. Therefore, even if you listen to the voice during a duel, hand information won't leak to your opponent.

The top of the card has the card type (monster, spell, trap) + card name written in Braille. This allows players who can read Braille and have memorized parameters and effects to skip the pen-touching process.

Since you can actually touch the cards while dueling, you can shout famous anime lines like "It's my turn, draw!" or "Burst Stream of Destruction!"
