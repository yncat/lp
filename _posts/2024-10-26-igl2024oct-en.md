IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab) has been hosting monthly game experience sessions since this year. We rent the venue at [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we had a double feature:

- [Four Senses](https://sugorokuya.jp/p/four-senses)
- [You Are the Ghost (Obake wa Omae da)](https://gift10industry.myshopify.com/products/you-are-the-ghost)

This time, due to fewer participants and scheduling constraints on the organizers' side, we held a shortened version.

By the way, sessions were also held in August and September, but since I couldn't attend, they're not written about on this site.

Four Senses is like a 3D four-in-a-row game. Details are available on the official site.

"You Are the Ghost" is a table-talk style game similar to werewolf. However, the discussion revolves around sounds as the theme. Various scary sounds are prepared, and everyone talks about these scary sounds, but only one person, the "ghost," cannot hear the sounds. But since you can't let on that you're the ghost, the concept is to mimic and deceive others by pretending you heard the sounds and acting accordingly.

In my previous post, I said I would include photos of snacks, but I already forgot, so there are no photos. Sorry about that.

The next session in November is scheduled for November 24th, but I won't be participating due to other commitments!
