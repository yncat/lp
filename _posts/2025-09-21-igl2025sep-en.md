[IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab)](https://x.com/IGL_official_AC) has been hosting monthly game experience events since 2024. We borrow the venue from [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we played:
- [1-2-SWITCH](https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/aacca/index.html)
- [13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim](https://atlus.com/13sentinels/lang/en/)

13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim is a game that has been out for quite some time, but it's famous among blind gamers as a title that can be completely beaten without looking at the screen.

For this game, we have also published a demonstration video on [IGL's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIDCOiiN8c), so please check it out.

## Snack Photo Corner - It's Been a While

It's been a while since we've posted photos of snacks. This time, we have strawberry shortcake.
