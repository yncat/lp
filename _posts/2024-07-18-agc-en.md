On July 13, 2024, the [Audio Game Center at Shibuya CCBT](https://ccbt.rekibun.or.jp/events/audiogamecenter_ccbt) opened.

As a kickoff event, we held an [Audio Game Creation Hackathon](https://ccbt.rekibun.or.jp/events/audiogamecenter_ccbt_hackathon). The hackathon took place during the three-day weekend from July 13-15.

I participated in three roles: organizer, blind facilitator, and developer, and created fun audio games with team members!

The audio games that everyone created are scheduled to be publicly available at the Audio Game Center CCBT venue around early to mid-August. Until then, the content will remain a surprise!
