[IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab)](https://x.com/IGL_official_AC) has been hosting monthly game experience sessions since 2024. We rent the venue at [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we had a triple feature:

- [Touchalle](https://ideapot.thebase.in/items/82918967)
- [Four Senses](https://sugorokuya.jp/p/four-senses)
- [Vulture's Prey (Hagetaka no Ejiki)](https://www.mobius-games.co.jp/mobiusgames/Hagetaka.html)

Vulture's Prey made its new appearance. By the way, while the original version is just cards, you can purchase a version with braille from the [Japan Braille Library website](https://yougu.nittento.or.jp/product2013_124.html).

Besides these, we've acquired other new accessible board games, so we'd like to introduce them at future experience sessions.

This time's snack was salted mont blanc. The crispy layer underneath has a nice salty flavor that's delicious.
