I had the opportunity to speak at an engineering event called [Goと歩むキャリアを考える Go-lang Career Bar](https://forkwell.connpass.com/event/305831/) as a freee employee. In my main job, I primarily use the Go language for product development, and we had passionate discussions about the behind-the-scenes work and the relationship between Go language and career development.

By the way, when I first registered for the event, I had to choose from cocktails representing various programming languages, and I chose the C++ cocktail. Not Go, seriously? I did drink Go later though. It was delicious.
