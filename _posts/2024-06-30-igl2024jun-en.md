IGL (Invisible Gaming Lab) has been hosting monthly game experience sessions since this year. We rent the venue at [Body Care Kitchen Luxen](https://luxen.jp/) in Sangenjaya.

This time, we played:
- [1-2-SWITCH](https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/aacca/index.html)
- [Nintendo Switch Sports](https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/as8sa/index.html)

1-2-SWITCH, with its concept of looking at each other's faces rather than the screen while playing, features games with various audio cues that can be played using sound alone. The next version, "Everybody," unfortunately adds more elements that require looking at the screen, which is a bit of a shame.

Nintendo Switch Sports is quite difficult to play accessibly when playing alone, but for the purpose of playing together in a group setting like this, I think it's well-made and quite enjoyable.

Digital games are difficult to photograph well, so sorry we can't include many photos.

Next time, on July 28th, we'll hold a board game session. Well, actually, I'm writing this after it's already been held. But that's a secret.
