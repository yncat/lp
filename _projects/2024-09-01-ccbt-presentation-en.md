We gave a lecture titled "The Future of Sound Technology and Audio Games" at the "Audio Game Center + CCBT" exhibition held at the Civic Creative Base Tokyo in Shibuya. This presentation was simultaneously streamed in both Japanese and English.

For this event, we invited a sound designer from [Lo-Fi People](https://www.facebook.com/lofipeople/), who developed the audio game [Blind Drive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1300600/Blind_Drive/?l=japanese) that can be enjoyed regardless of whether you have vision or not, to Japan. We discussed the future of audio games based on the various sound technologies incorporated into Blind Drive.
