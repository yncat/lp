In July 2019, [MyTrueSound](https://www.mytruesound.com/), an indie game developer from Finland, launched a project to recruit music for their audio game "AudioWizards" through a competition among visually impaired composers.

I contributed music to this competition and was selected. In the actual game, my track is used during the latter half stages.

Actually, I provided a complete mixed version as the "master mix" and also sent separate stems for each track, but due to some mechanical naming process, the supplementary information "master mix" ended up being included in the song title. Oh well, that's part of the charm.

The original track is available on [my personal homepage](https://nyanchangames.com/music/player.php?listen=sorcery). However, the in-game version has a slightly different mix, so you can enjoy it with a slightly different feel.

To commemorate the adoption of my music, they specially sent me a custom T-shirt all the way from Finland.
