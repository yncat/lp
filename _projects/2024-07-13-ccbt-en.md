From July 13 to September 16, 2024, we are hosting an Audio Game Center at the "Civic Creative Base Tokyo" in Shibuya.

![Photo of the "AUDIO GAME CENTER" entrance. In the center is a large circular table surrounded by headphones. On the table is a neon sign reading "AUDIO GAME CENTER". In the background are panels explaining the exhibition, which read "Creating from sound, playing with sound. The 'Audio Game Center' that stimulates our imagination and creativity." The exhibition period is July 13 to September 16, 2024, from 13:00 to 19:00.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/agc-ccbt.jpg#wide)

## Re-exhibition of "Screaming Strike Neo"

We are re-exhibiting "Screaming Strike Neo", a rhythm action game that was displayed at the [2021 Sony Park exhibition](https://yncat.net/project/sonypark). This time, we've newly added support for playing in English. For detailed game content, please refer to the Sony Park exhibition article.

In addition to this work, all other works from the Sony Park exhibition are also available at CCBT.

## Exhibition of New Work "Audio AR Game Maker"

Although I haven't written an article about it yet, we're also exhibiting "Audio AR Game Maker" at CCBT, a work that debuted at last year's BitSummit. This is a unique piece where you can walk around an audio-only AR space and create your own gameplay by placing various sounds.

## Experience Corner for Various Past Audio Games

We've set up an area where you can play several audio games that I've carefully selected from the hundreds of audio games that exist worldwide. The lineup is as follows:

- [Atodashi Janken (Delayed Rock-Paper-Scissors)](https://nyanchangames.com/softs/atodasi_janken.exe) (Sorry, it's my own game)
- [AudioStrike](https://hirotaka2014.sakura.ne.jp/mh0406/game/as.htm)
- [MineSweeper](https://hirotaka2014.sakura.ne.jp/mh0406/game/mine-hsp.zip)
- Din (No download source available, can't be downloaded anymore)
- [Audio Game Hub](https://audiogamehub.com/)
- [Blind Drive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1300600/Blind_Drive/?l=japanese)

The top 4 games can all be played on the same PC. You can select games with a click, listen to rules and operation instructions, and explanatory audio commentary I recorded myself in both Japanese and English, then play however you like. This PC comes with NVDA pre-installed, so even if totally blind visitors come, they can select and play games!

## Console Game Gameplay Videos

We're screening gameplay videos of games like "The Last Of Us" series, famous for being a hardcore horror action game that became accessible, and the "Rhythm Heaven series", which wasn't designed with accessibility in mind but ended up being playable with audio only. I'm the one playing in these videos too.

By the way, for The Last of Us, we're using Part I due to the timing of scary scenes, and for Rhythm Heaven, we're using the Wii version "Rhythm Heaven Fever" due to screen considerations.
