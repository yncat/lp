I exhibited as a member of [Seiken Lab](https://seiken-lab.com/) at [SightWorld](https://www.sight-world.com/), a comprehensive event for people with visual impairments.

At Seiken Lab, engineers who love making things gathered around Seiken-san, who loves inventing, and we exhibited at SightWorld. We showcased several works, with the [Ultrasonic Walking Assistance Device JSB01](https://seiken-lab.com/products/jsb01/) as the main exhibit.

I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to present the "Atodashi Janken (Delayed Rock-Paper-Scissors) web version" that I was planning right after the Vision Consortium, so I completed it in time for Sight World.

Please give it a try!
