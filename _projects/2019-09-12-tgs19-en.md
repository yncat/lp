We exhibited at the indie game corner of Tokyo Game Show 2019, held from September 12-15, 2019, as [Audio Game Center](https://audiogame.center).

This time, we created a completely original work. Using a custom spray-type controller, visitors enjoyed an unprecedented audio game experience of exterminating mosquitoes flying around their heads.
