From June 26 to July 18, 2021, we exhibited an Audio Game Center at the Ginza Sony Park.

This was the first time for Audio Game Center to display works by three creators.

## Nozawa Area

Combining "hitting" actions with audio games, visitors could play two different types of games:

- "Flying Tiles Edition" - breaking flying tiles with karate moves
- "Zombie Edition" - endlessly hitting approaching zombies to defeat them

## Taka Area

Visitors could experience "Audio Racing", where they actually sat on a car, gripped the steering wheel, and experienced realistic arcade racing. I played it many times myself. The tactile feedback was wonderfully crafted, with elements like being startled by animals along the course and having the steering wheel taken away by alien attacks.

## Tanaka Area

A storytelling horror game called "Where the Ghosts Are" was unveiled, where participants entered a dark room and explored it relying on sound. Scary sounds came from various parts of the room, but participants had to overcome their fear, approach these sounds, explore, and reach the truth of the story. I only got to play it once, so I'd love to realize another exhibition somewhere - it was truly wonderful content.
