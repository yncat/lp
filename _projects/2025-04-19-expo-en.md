At Gallery West of the Osaka Expo, we were given the opportunity to exhibit an audio game center at the "Vision Consortium" booth, thanks to an invitation from Mainichi Shimbun.

This time, we exhibited "Screaming Strike Neo" and "Audio Racing".

The exhibition was held from April 19th to 24th, and many visitors came to experience our games.
