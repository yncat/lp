As a 2023 project of the Audio Game Center, we exhibited at [BitSummit 2023](https://bitsummit.org/2023/) held in Kyoto.

We made our debut exhibition of "Audio AR Game Maker," a tool that allows users to build AR spaces composed entirely of sound using smartphones and tablets, and create audio games.

As a related event, we held a workshop where participants could actually create and play games using the Audio AR Game Maker at [HOTEL ANTEROOM KYOTO](https://www.uds-hotels.com/anteroom/kyoto/) near the venue.

In the development of this application, I was not involved in programming. I participated as a sound designer and user interface director.
